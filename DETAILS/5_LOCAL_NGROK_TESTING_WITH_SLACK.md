# Local Setup with Ngrok and Slack Integration Improvements

In 4_setup_slack_integration.md, we discussed setting up the integration paths, creating Python Flask Listeners, and running it with Ngrok for our bot to communicate with Slack. This guide, will examine the enhancements made to our local setup and the bot's behavior using Ngrok for local testing and the addition of threaded conversations in Slack to simulate realistic interactions.

## Prerequisites

- Pre-existing setup following the guide in 4_setup_slack_integration.md.
- The updated [`slack_events_listener.py`](https://github.com/tillo13/microsoft_bot_framework/blob/main/INTEGRATIONS/SLACK/slack_events_listener.py) file.
- The new [`bot_logic.py`](https://github.com/tillo13/microsoft_bot_framework/blob/main/INTEGRATIONS/SLACK/bot_logic.py) and [`bot_adapter.py`](https://github.com/tillo13/microsoft_bot_framework/blob/main/INTEGRATIONS/SLACK/bot_adapter.py) files.
- A `.env` file with your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable.

## First Improvement: Adding Threaded Conversations

One of the main additions to our setup is the ability of our bot to participate in threaded conversations. In Slack, threads allow users to branch off a conversation for more focused discussions. Our bot is now equipped to reply in these thread contexts.

In the [`slack_events_listener.py`](https://github.com/tillo13/microsoft_bot_framework/blob/main/INTEGRATIONS/SLACK/slack_events_listener.py) file, there's a new function `get_thread_starter_user_id()` which retrieves the user ID of the thread starter. This enables the bot to identify the user who initiated the thread and keep track of conversations.

Bot responses are now threaded as well. Refer to the `slack_events()` function, where a new thread is initiated each time the bot needs to process an activity using `Thread(target=process_activity, args=(event,)).start()`.

## Second Improvement: Parsing Implicit Invocations

The bot now responds not just to explicit invocations (i.e., when `@bot` is used), but also to implicit mentions. This refers to instances where the bot's id is included in the text blocks. You can see this functionality in the `message_from_blocks()` function.

## Third Improvement: Enhanced Bot Memory

In [`bot_logic.py`](https://github.com/tillo13/microsoft_bot_framework/blob/main/INTEGRATIONS/SLACK/bot_logic.py) file, the `talk_to_chatbot()` method is significantly improved with better memory management. The bot now checks for `thread_ts`, a timestamp associated with each Slack message. When it is not `None`, it retrieves 'thread' conversation history using `conversations_replies()` and parses this information into a format that the OpenAI chat model understands.

This history gives the bot better context, preventing repetition of information and giving more accurate responses. 

## Fourth Improvement: Verbose Mode Debugging

The new Verbose Mode offers an additional layer for debugging. When `VERBOSE_MODE` is set to True in [`slack_events_listener.py`](https://github.com/tillo13/microsoft_bot_framework/blob/main/INTEGRATIONS/SLACK/slack_events_listener.py), the bot posts detailed JSON payloads from OpenAI to the Slack channel, helping developers understand how the bot formulates its responses.

## Note

Remember to replace the URLs in the "[`slack_events_listener.py`](https://github.com/tillo13/microsoft_bot_framework/blob/main/INTEGRATIONS/SLACK/slack_events_listener.py)" references to point at your actual github repo if you plan to publish these documents.

## Running the Python Flask App

To run your updated bot, use the command appropriate for your operating system in your terminal:

- **MacOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=slack_events_listener.py
    flask run
    ```
- **Windows CMD:**
    ```cmd
    set FLASK_APP=slack_events_listener.py
    flask run
    ```
- **Windows PowerShell:**
    ```powershell
    $env:FLASK_APP = "slack_events_listener.py"
    flask run
    ```
Then, start Ngrok in another terminal window with the command `ngrok http 3000`.

the bot, now armed with threaded conversations, implicit invocations, advanced memory, and verbose debugging, is an impressive evolution from the original local setup!

## Next Potential Steps

Now that we've successfully made substantial enhancements to the bot, the next big move could be hosting it on a stable and scalable platform like Azure. Hosting the bot on Azure not only introduces better management, resilience, and scalability, but also allows for integration with other Azure services. Here's what you could consider for your next steps:

1. **Host the bot on Azure:** Migrate the bot from a local setup to Azure for increased stability and scalability. Using Azure Bot Service, you can manage, connect, and deploy the bot across multiple channels. 

2. **Utilize Azure Functions or Logic Apps:** You can maintain the bot's logic and management of messages received from Slack via Azure Functions (serverless computing service that runs your code on-demand) or Logic Apps (visual designer service to automate workflows). This could result in enhanced scalability and simpler code.

3. **Leverage Azure Cognitive Services:** Enhance the bot's capabilities even further with Azure's AI services like Language Understanding (LUIS) to improve the bot's language comprehension, or the Text Analytics API for more refined sentiment analysis. 

4. **Automate Deployment with GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines:** Automating your deployment process can make your iterations faster and more efficient. Each time you push changes to your GitHub repository, you can set up an automatic re-deployment of the bot on Azure.

5. **Integrate with Azure's Monitoring and Analytics Tools:** Tools like Azure Monitor and Application Insights can provide valuable insights into the bot's performance and usage statistics, helping you continually improve the bot based on user behavior and interactions.

6. **Multi-Bot Management with Bot Framework Composer:** If you plan to develop more bots or complex dialogs, Azure's Bot Framework Composer could be a valuable tool. It is an open-source visual authoring canvas for developers and multi-disciplinary teams to design and build conversational experiences with Language Understanding, QnA Maker, and a sophisticated composition of bot replies (Language Generation).
